# VVSteamNetworking
Low and High level APIs for networking through Steam Sockets.

A series of systems used to send messages over Steam's Networking sockets.
More efficient and secure than P2P messages, this repo provides some code that should mainly be used as a reference (code quality may not be to your standards!)

Feel free to use any code in any of your own projects! No attribution required! Go right ahead.

Examples and updates to be added.
